This will be your about page. You may use this, or you can put all this information on your homepage. Completely your choice!

If you remove your about page:
- Remember to remove /about from the nav!
- If you want to get really fancy, if your website has already been [crawled by Google][google-crawl-docs], see if you can create a [301 redirect][google-301-redirect-docs] from your /about page to your / homepage.

## Jekyll
This template website uses the base [Jekyll minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme ([preview Jekyll minima site][jekyll-minima-preview]). You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

Jekyll is [open-source software][about-open-source]! You can find the source code for Jekyll at GitHub:
